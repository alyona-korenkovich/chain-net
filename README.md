<h2>Running the app (Docker)</h2>
1. Install Docker
2. Clone
   
   `git clone https://github.com/alyona-korenkovich/chain-net.git`
   
   `cd chain-net`
3. Run `docker compose up`
4. Voil√† -- three nodes are started and now mining on ports 3000, 3001, 3002

<h2>Example</h2>
On the image below one can see what it looks like when containers are running in console.<br>
>It needs to be noticed that containers require ports 3000-3002 to be available since it is a study-project, and they are hard-coded.

As we can see on the screen, all three nodes are connected to one another and have synchronized chains.
